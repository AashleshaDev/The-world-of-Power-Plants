SPRINT-4
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ) 
1. What has been achieved in the Sprint 4?
A. In SPRINT 4, we worked on read and create a heatmap representing coal and nuclear power plants in the presentation 
   layer and business logic layer. Read and Update overlays in the presentation layer.

2. What should be the connection string name when you submit the file to the Product Owner?
A. You need to change the Connection string name as below. You need to change at these places : Program.cs(GlobalPowerPlants_Tester), PowerPlant.aspx.cs, Xouthos_CoalHeatMap.aspx.cs and Xouthos_NuclearHeatMap.aspx.cs
   DB = new DataAccessClass("Server=DESKTOP-IU04KMD\\GREENE_001;Database=DB_ProjectGlobalPowerPlants;Trusted_Connection=Yes;"); 

3. How did you implement heatmaps in the project?
A. Plant Capacity was used as the weight for the heatmap. Lambdas were used to read power plants with nuclear and coal fuel types.
   A menu system was implemented to switch back and forth between the heatmaps for different fuel types.

4. How did you implement overlays in the project?
A. A list box of selection items was created which allows the user to select the fuel type based on which the respective markers will be shown on the web page/map.
   Also a graphical representation of the total number of power plants based on its fuel type has been displayed onto the map representing an overlay read functionality.

5. Any comments about the sprint?
A. The coders have confirmed validation from the Product Owner about their code implementation and achieving the target of 20 points each for their respective work.
   The Scrum Master and Promote Person have worked from the code provided by the coders with the understanding that the required complexity for the sprint has been acheived.
   We would like to implement the task provided to us as feedback for Sprint 3 (solve the problem of page taking long time to load) in Sprint 5 since we have already 
   finished working on Sprint 4 and the team members have requested the product owner to address this issue for the last sprint.

6. Do you have any extra points in the bank?
A. We have 15 points from Sprint-3 which carries forward from the Polyline implementation in the presentation layer.So total 15 points in the bank from the previous sprint. 
   We also have 6 points from Sprint-4 , reading a heatmap in the presentation layer and business logic layer in this sprint.
